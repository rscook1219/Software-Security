# Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  Artemis Financial is a company who specializes in the financial planning ranging from retirment to savings. They wanted us to help secure their app and identify any security risks they may have.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

  I think I provided ample risk assessment and solutions to those risks. It is important to code securely because it allows for data protection, adds reputation and trust for the company, decreases costs for fixing vulnerabilities, and it is your ethical responsibility. These combined add to the companies overall wellbeing by saving them time, money, and increasing trust from clients. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  The false positives to me was kind of challenging as well as sometimes getting the CheckSum to run how it is supposed to. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased layers of security by scanning for vulnerabilities and assessment. I would use good incident response plans as well as looking for false positives. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  I ran a dependency check and then followed up by running another one after the code was fixed to see if it found anymore risks as then I suppressed the false positives to make sure that the security risks found were real. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  I think running dependency checks and see what it finds and figuring out what is real and what is not was very helpful to me and can be very helpful for the future. I never knew that you can include that in a maven build and I was suprised to see what all it found and how many were false positives. I think being able to identify those will be very helpful in the future. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  I would show them that I can identify false positives as well as code securely where there are no errors and that I know how to print, store, and create a security certificate.
